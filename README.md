TuffX allowing players to see and beat a trial chamber.

> [!WARNING]
> This is not a "crack" for Minecraft, it simply allows for better TuffClient integration on servers.

## Quick Start
Install the latest jar from [releases](https://github.com/TuffNetwork/TuffX-Plugin/releases/latest/) into your server's `plugins` folder. Then, restart your server, and join via TuffClient. You should now be able to use extra features such as below y0 and ViaBlocks!

## Compiling
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/TuffNetwork/TuffX-Plugin
$ cd TuffX-Plugin
$ mvn clean install
```

The built plugin jar will be in the `target` folder.
